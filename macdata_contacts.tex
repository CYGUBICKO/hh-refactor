\section{Distinction between MacDATA proposal and PhD project}

The proposed project and the candidate's Ph.D. research take different computational and methodological approaches to investigate different public-health problems:

\begin{itemize}
\item Aims and scope of PhD thesis
\begin{itemize}
\item Using machine learning methods to build, validate and compare prognostic ML models to predict survival in patients with cancer using both clinical and patient reported outcomes, and incorporating changes in the measured covariates over time using unique databases available in Ontario, Canada
\end{itemize}
\item Aims and scope of MacDATA project
\begin{itemize}
\item A multivariate multilevel analysis for binary outcomes: correlates of sanitary improvements in the slums of Nairobi
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
The first case focuses on ML-based cross-validation to evaluate predictive models for maximized predictive performance on unobserved outcomes. In the second case we propose statistical modeling together with simulation-based validation approaches to majorly focus on causal inference of model parameters.

Many techniques from statistical methods (SM) and machine learning (ML) overlap. However, SM has a well established focus on inference by building probabilistic models which allows us to determine a quantitative measure of confidence about the clarity of the true effect. Simulation-based validation approaches can be used in conjunction with SM to explicitly verify assumptions and redefine the specified model, if necessary. On the other hand, ML uses general-purpose algorithms to find patterns that best predict the outcome and makes minimal assumptions about the data-generating process; and may be more effective in a number of situations \citep{bzdok2018points}. However, despite convincing predictive performance and flexibility, the lack of explicit models in most ML methods can make ML results difficult to directly link to prior public health knowledge.
